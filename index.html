                <i>This calming pose is a good default pause position. You can use child’s pose to rest 
                and refocus before continuing to your next pose. It gently stretches your lower back, hips, 
                thighs, knees and ankles and relaxes your spine, shoulders and neck.
                Do it: When you want to get a nice gentle stretch through your neck spine and hips.
                Skip it: If you have knee injuries or ankle problems. Avoid also if you have high blood pressure or are pregnant.

                <b><i><u>Modify:</u></i></b> You can rest your head on a cushion or block. You can place a rolled towel under your ankles if they are uncomfortable.
                Be mindful: Focus on relaxing the muscles of the spine and lower back as you breathe.</i>
